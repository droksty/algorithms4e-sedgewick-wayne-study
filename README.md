ADTs and solutions developed during a slow study of Algorithms 4th Edition 1st Printing by Robert Sedgewick &amp; Keyvin Wayne.

I view this book as an opportunity to practice core OOP and Java while studying algorithms.

This repo requires no additional dependencies or libraries, though I may need to add the ones developed by the authors in the future.
For the moment, I will try to keep everything as basic Java as possible.

Any corrections or suggestions are more than welcome!
