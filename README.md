# Algorithms 4th Edition 1st Printing
ADTs and solutions developed during a very slow study of Algorithms book Robert Sedgewick &amp; Keyvin Wayne.
I view this book as an opportunity to practice core OOP and Java while studying algorithms.
This repo requires no additional dependencies or libraries, though I may need to add the ones provided by the authors in the future.
For the moment, I try to keep everything as basic Java as possible.
